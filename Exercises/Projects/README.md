This section includes the two most challenging projects faced on the course. I didn`t translate them to english because they were already too big to make these kind of alterations, but the code can be read 

1) NIM Game
The first one was made halfway through the course, and the objective was to create a NIM game which a player faces an unbeatable computer. 

The computer is unbeatable because of two important factors:
a) It uses a formula to determine how many pieces the computer will subtract from the board each turn;
b) The said formula will also let the computer chooses who starts, being the most important part of the game, "defining" who will win.

The making of this little game was very challenging at first, as it was the first complete piece of software in the course, but it was also very nice to see it working as intended after finishing it. 


2) COH_PIA

As the final project of the course, the task was to implement a text plagiarism detector. We were given a code with some auxiliary functions already written, and the main objective was to implement 3 functions that, when working properly, compare a "model" text to any number of submitted texts and then printing on the screen which of the given texts has the most chance of being plagiarism. 

The functioning of the software calculates the "signature" of a text, a combination of six characteristics such as average lenght of words in the text, average lenght of sentences, average complexity of sentences, etc. Then, calculates the signatures of each text and then compares to the signature submitted by the user, to be used as model signature. 

I found this one very interesting to do, it was a "real world problem" and, after tinkering a little bit with the functions I put together the software (the objective was to just put together 3 functions, not wrapping the software), and it can be actually used by anyone to compare texts, even though it lacks interface and easy usability.
