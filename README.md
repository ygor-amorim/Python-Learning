Hi! Im glad to share my proposed resolutions to the exercises shared by the introductory course i attended online, since the objective is not to share answers to people that are currently attending, and the course has an honor code to not share full answers, since they can be harmful to the progress of other students, i will omit the course name for now.

The solutions in this list were made when I was first getting into the subject (the only changes made was translating to english), so it should assumed they are definitely not the ideal solution. I will most certainly revisit them later in the future and try more advanced approaches as my programming gets better.

<b> Note that the purpose of this is for ONLY sharing my progress in the subject. If you are currently attending to this aforementioned course i encourage you to first do your own solutions BEFORE viewing any of the proposed solutions in this list. </b>
